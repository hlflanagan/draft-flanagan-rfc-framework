Abstract

   The canonical format for the RFC Series has been ASCII for several
   decades.  After extensive community discussion and debate, the RFC
   Editor will be transitioning to XML as the canonical format, with
   different publication formats rendered from that base document.
   These changes are intended to increase the usability of the RFC
   Series by offering documents that match the needs of a wide variety
   of stakeholders.  With these changes, however, comes a significant
   increase in complexity.  This document serves as the framework that
   describes the problems being solved and summarizes the many documents
   created that capture the specific requirements for each aspect of the
   change in format.

   Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list
   (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www
   .rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest [1].

1.  Introduction

   In RFC 6949, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development,"
   the need for additional features within RFCs such as non-ASCII

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   characters to respect author names, more advanced artwork than ASCII
   art, and documents that could display properly on a wide variety of
   devices was discussed [RFC6949].  Based on the discussions with the
   IETF community as well as other communities of interest, the decision
   was made by the RFC Series Editor to explore a change to the format
   of the Series [XML-ANNOUNCE].  This document serves as the framework
   that describes the problems being solved and summarizes the documents
   created to-date that capture the specific requirements for each
   aspect of the change in format.

   Key changes that have, based on feedback on the rfc-interest mailing
   list as well as meetings with the community, been of the greatest
   interest are highlighted, and a description of the transition plan
   that will take the Series from ASCII only to the new formats are also
   described [RFC-INTEREST].

2.  Problem Statement

   When the first RFCs were published 45 years ago, the tools to create
   and read RFCs were limited.  The need for any characters outside the
   ASCII range did not start until several years and over a thousand
   documents into the Series [need to verify; first one I can find was
   RFC 1456] and distribution was limited to individuals who had access
   to the burgeoning Internet.

   Today, there are nearly three billion people connected to the
   Internet and individuals from over ## countries regularly attending
   IETF meetings [ISTATS] [add stats to the appendix or point to a web
   page somewhere?].  The world has changed from when the first RFCs
   were published, but the Series remains critical to defining
   protocols, standards, best practices, and more for a global network
   that continues to grow.  In order to make RFCs easily read to the
   largest number of people possible, regardless of device, and to
   respect the diversity of authors and reference materials, it is time
   to change from the tightly prescribed format of the RFC Series.

   Of course, the requirements for the RFC Series must take into account
   communities beyond existing authors and readers.  Implementors
   outside of the IETF, lawyers that argue Intellectual Property Rights
   (IPR), and even policy-makers that need to know what to list in
   potential RFPs for their organizations, all have preferences and
   requirements for their specific needs, in addition to the particular
   preferences and requirements of RFC authors.

3.  Terminology

   RFC 2119 keywords are not used in this document.

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   Terminology as described in RFC 6949:

   ASCII: Coded Character Set - 7-bit American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange, ANSI X3.4-1986

   Canonical format: the authorized, recognized, accepted, and archived
   version of the document

   Metadata: information associated with a document so as to provide,
   for example, definitions of its structure, or of elements within the
   document such as its topic or author

   Publication format: display and distribution format as it may be read
   or printed after the publication process has completed

   Reflowable text: text that automatically wraps to the next line in a
   document as the user moves the margins of the text, either by
   resizing the window or changing the font size

   Revisable format: the format that will provide the information for
   conversion into a Publication format; it is used or created by the
   RFC Editor (see Section 2.3 for an explanation of current practice)

   Submission format: the format submitted to the RFC Editor for
   editorial revision and publication

4.  Overview of the Decision Making Process

   Requirements, use cases, concerns, and suggestions were collected
   from the communities of interest at every stage of the RFC format
   change project.  Input was received through the rfc-interest mailing
   list, as well as face-to-face sessions at IETF meetings.  Updates
   regarding the status of the project were offered to the IETF
   community during the IETF Technical Plenary as well as Format BoFs or
   IAB sessions at IETF 84, IETF 85, IETF 88, IETF 89, and IETF 90
   [IETF84] [IETF85] [IETF88] [IETF89] [IETF90].

   The first document published, RFC 6949, provided the first solid
   documentation on what the requirements were for the Series and in
   effect was the output from the first year of discussion on the topic
   of RFC format.  That RFC was published as an IAB stream document,
   thus following the process described in RFC 4845, "Process for
   Publication of IAB RFCs" [RFC4845].

   After the high level requirements were published, a Design Team was
   brought together to start working out the necessary details to inform
   the development of code to support new and changed formats.  While
   the bi-weekly calls for this team were closed, review of the drafts



Flanagan                Expires February 13, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   produced by this team were done publicly, both through requests for
   input on the rfc-interest mailing list, as well as requests for early
   GenART reviews.  Several of the subsequent drafts produced by the RFC
   Format Design Team, including the XML v2 and v3 drafts and the SVG
   profile drafts, were sent through an early GenART review before
   starting the process to be accepted as an IAB stream draft [GEN-ART].
   [If/when we get the Security Directorate review, add that here.]

   While the IETF community provided the majority of input on the
   process, additional outreach opportunities were sought to gain input
   from an even broader audience.  Informal discussions were held with
   participants at several International Association of Scientific,
   Technical, and Medical Publisher events, and presentations made at
   technical conferences such as the TERENA Networking Conference 2014
   and NORDUnet 2014 [TNC2014] [NORDUnet link TBD].

   In order to respond to concerns regarding responses to subpoenas and
   to understand the requirements for lawyers, advice regarding the
   changes in format was sought direction from the IETF Trust legal team
   [note: work in progress].

   Given that several other SDOs either do not or have not ever offered
   plain text, informal input was sought from them as well regarding
   their experience with supporting multiple formats for their
   standards.

   Finally, the entire process was reviewed regularly with the RFC
   Series Oversight Committee and regular updates provided to the IAB
   and IESG [RSOC].

   Where consensus was not reached during the process, the RSE made
   decisions, as per the guidance in RFC 6635, "RFC Editor Model
   (Version 2)" [RFC6635].

5.  Key Changes

   At the highest level, the changes being made to the RFC Format
   involve breaking away from a pure-ASCII mode and moving to canonical
   format that includes all the information required for rendering a
   document into a wide variety of publication formats.  The RFC Editor
   will become responsible for more than just the canonical plain text
   file and the PDF-from-text format created at time of publication;
   they will be creating different formats in order to meet the diverse
   requirements of the community.

   A short summary of changes for each document format is listed below.
   For more detail, please see the sections later in this document and
   review the drafts.

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   Plain text:

   o  no longer the canonical version

   o  non-ASCII characters will be allowed in .txt files

   o  BOMs will be added at the start of each file

   o  widow and orphan control will not have priority

   PDF:

   o  no longer derived from the plain text document

   o  will include a rich set of tags and metadata within the document

   o  will conform to PDF/A-3

   o  line art, if available, will be included

   HTML:

   o  a new format for the RFC Editor; this will not be the same as the
      tools.ietf.org generated HTML files

   o  semantic HTML + override-able CSS

   o  line art, if available, will be included

   o  text will be reflowable

   XML:

   o  this will be the canonical version that contains all information
      necessary to render a variety of formats

   o  the canonical XML vocabulary will be the v3 vocabulary; authors
      may submit drafts in v2 vocabulary, but the final publication will
      convert that to v3

6.  Document Summary

6.1.  Canonical Format Documents

6.1.1.  XML

   [draft-reschke-xml2rfc] - Describes the xml2rfc v2 vocabulary.  While
   in wide use today, this vocabulary had not been formally documented.



Flanagan                Expires February 13, 2015               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   In order to understand what needed to change in the vocabulary to
   allow for a more simple experience and additional features for
   authors, the current vocabulary needed to be fully described.  This
   document will be almost immediately obsoleted by draft-hoffman-
   xml2rfc.

   [draft-hoffman-xml2rfc] - Describes the xml2rfc v3 vocabulary.  The
   design goals in this vocabulary were to make the vocabulary more
   intuitive for authors, and to expand the features to support the
   changes being made in the publication process.

6.2.  Publication Format Documents

6.2.1.  HTML

   [draft-hildebrand-html-rfc] - Describes the semantic HTML that will
   be produced by the RFC Editor from the xml2rfc v3 files.

6.2.2.  PDF

   [draft-hansen-rfc-use-of-pdf] - Describes the tags and profiles that
   will be used to create the new PDF format.

6.2.3.  Plain Text

   [draft-flanagan-plaintext] - Describes the details of the plain text
   format, focusing in particular on what is changing from the existing
   plain text output.

6.2.4.  SVG

   [draft-brownlee-svg-rfc] - describes the profile for SVG line art.
   SVG is an XML-based vocabulary for creating line drawings; SVG
   information will be embedded within the canonical XML at time of
   publication.

6.2.5.  Potential Future Publication Formats

6.2.5.1.  EPUB

6.3.  Content and Page Layout

6.3.1.  Non-ASCII Characters

   [draft-flanagan-nonascii] - There are security and readability
   implications to moving outside the ASCII range of characters.  This
   draft focuses on exactly where and how non-ASCII characters may be
   used in an RFC, with an eye towards keeping the documents as secure

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   and readable as possible given the information that needs to be
   expressed.

6.3.2.  Document Formatting

   (addendum to the Style Guide; hasn't been drafted yet)

6.3.3.  Digital Preservation Policy

   [HF: This is about the long-term, formal archival process for RFCs.
   Not sure if a pointer to this should be included in the framework
   draft.  It is something that must be documented as we make the RFC
   Series more complex, but it isn't really part of the format work
   directly.]

6.3.4.  Style Guide

   [draft-iab-styleguide] - The RFC Style Guide was revised to remove as
   much page formatting information as possible, focusing instead on
   grammar, structure, and content of RFCs.

6.3.5.  CSS Requirements

7.  Transition Plan

7.1.  Testing Phase

   During document review and approved for submission phase, authors and
   stream-approving body will select drafts to run through the new
   process, noting that final publication will continue to be in plain
   text only.  In order to limit the amount of time the RFC Production
   Center (RPC) spends on testing and QA, note that their priority is to
   edit and publish documents, community assistance will be necessary to
   help move this stage along.

   Purpose of testing phase: work with the community to identify and fix
   bugs in the process and the code, before producing canonical,
   immutable XML.  Also need to have more critical eyes on the
   publication formats.

   Known risks:

   Criteria to indicate success: RPC and Tools Development team to
   review bugs and decide when all show-stoppers have been dealt with.

7.2.  Transition Phase

Internet-Draft            RFC Format Framework               August 2014


   Documents submitted with an XML file will go through the new process
   to produce a canonical XML document and the available publication
   formats.  Documents submitted as plain text will be published as
   plain text only; they will not be converted to XML by the RPC.

   Purpose of transition phase: this is a time to introduce the process
   to the community at large.  Additional bugs will be found and fixed,
   and workflow refined.

   Known risks: More work on the part of the RPC to support both old and
   new publication processes for some unknown period of time.  There is
   potential for confusion as consumers of RFCs find some documents
   published at this time with a full set of outputs, while other
   documents only have plain text.  There may be a delay in publication
   as new bugs are found that must be fixed before the files can be
   converted into the canonical format and associated publication
   formats.

   Criteria to indicate success: All major and critical bugs are
   resolved.  Rough consensus from the community regarding the utility
   of the new formats.

7.3.  Completion

   All drafts submitted for publication, including text, will be
   converted to XML and published as a Canonical XML file with available
   publication formats.

   Known risks: Higher work load for the RPC as, in addition to the
   grammar and style editing, they also create and/or encourage best
   practice with the XML structure.

   Criteria to indicate success: Costs and resources stabilize for the
   new process.
